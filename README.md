# Smart-Contract-MAD
As we move towards a more utopic society, we must find better ways to to resolve conflict. This contract takes commitment(value) from neighboring countries in hopes of entering into a period of peace and stability between the contracted parties. Once entering into commitment the parties will be locked in escrow for a specific period of time. They can only exit and renegotiate the contract after the contract has expired. If one country wishes to destroy their neighboring country's funds, they must destroy their own funds as well. They can only destroy their neighbor, if they agree to destroy themselves. Mutually Assured Destruction.
